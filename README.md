Assignment 2: httpserver.c

This is the README.md file. 

Necessary instructions for running the code:
Open 2 terminals. Type make on the command line of the server terminal and that should create a binary executable file called httpserver. Run the server terminal by typing ./httpserver address# port# -N (#numThreads) -r (optional)

The other terminal is the client terminal which runs curl commands for PUT and GET which are specified on the DESIGN document on how to run those curl commands. We specified the test cases for curl on our DESIGN document.

Files for submission:
1.httpserver.cpp
2.DESIGN.pdf
3.Makefile
4.README.md
5.Queue.cpp
6.Queue.h
